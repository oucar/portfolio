      <p className="mb-3">
        After completing my education at Purdue University with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Computer Science</span> and a minor in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Mathematics</span>, I delved into the
        realm of software development. My journey began with a profound interest
        in problem-solving, leading me to master technologies such as{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">React</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Next.js</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Node.js</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">MongoDB</span>, and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">many more!</span> Proficient in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">TypeScript</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">C#</span>, I am committed to continuous
        learning and am eager to explore emerging technologies in the software
        industry.

        Outside of coding, I embrace a diverse range of interests and
        activities. Originating from TÃ¼rkiye, I have a deep appreciation for
        nature and enjoy <span className="font-medium">kayaking</span> in serene
        waters. I am also passionate about{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">3D printing</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">photography</span>, using these mediums to
        express creativity and capture memorable moments. In my pursuit of
        knowledge, I delve into subjects such as{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">history</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">philosophy</span>, constantly seeking to
        broaden my understanding of the world. Additionally, I find solace in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          playing analog synthesizers and drums!
        </span>
        . Spending quality time with my cat is also one of my favorite
        comforting activities.
